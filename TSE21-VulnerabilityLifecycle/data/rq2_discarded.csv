When using certificate authentication the CERT payload is mandatory and as the. name suggests is used to send a certificate containing a public key used for. the authentication signature.. For pubkey authentication the key is preshared and stored locally but only. the 'ca' process can read the local keys. The 'ikev2' process had to get the. key from the received CERT payload to verify the authentication signature.. The peer ID + raw key was then forwarded to the 'ca' process which. compared the key against the contents of /etc/iked/pubkey and returned either. CERTVALID or CERTINVALID.. With this change a message containing only the ID may be sent from 'ikev2' to. the 'ca' process if CERT was not included. In this case the CA process will. try to find a local key matching the ID and return it to the 'ikev2' process.. The auth verification happens after the 'ca' process has verified or found a. key and returned it to the 'ikev2' process eliminating the need for. the CERT payload.. Making CERTREQ optional is easier because we already have a fallback case if. the CERTREQ can not be fulfilled. If no CERTREQ was received we now use this. same fallback.. This should fix public key authentication interoperability with *swan and. other IKEv2 implementations.. ok and tested by kn@. ok patrick@,tobhe@openbsd.org,0.08,0.002,0.034,2020-07-15 14:45:15+00:00,,CVE-2020-16088,CWE-639,7.5

Simplify code and do not impose an order on conditions and rule options.. Format changes that may require smtpd.conf update for some setups:. - SSL certificates are no longer automatically loaded but must be. explicitely declared using the 'pki' keyword.. - 'certificate' option becomes 'pki' in listener and accept rules.. - 'ssl://' becomes 'secure://' in relay via rules.. - 'helo' becomes 'hostnames' in relay rules. New features:. - accept rules do not need an explicit action in which case alias table. or .forward must provide one.. - new 'forward-only' action to force relaying and reject rcpts that expand. as local delivery.. - '!' (negation) modifier on rule matching conditions.. - new 'recipient' rule matching condition.. - new 'verify' option on listeners and relay rules to reject invalid. certificates..
