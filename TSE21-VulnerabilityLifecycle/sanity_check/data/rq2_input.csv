Jay Fenlason (fenlason@redhat.com) found a bug . that recvfrom() on an RDS socket can return the contents of random kernel. memory to userspace if it was called with a address length larger than. sizeof(struct sockaddr_in).. rds_recvmsg() also fails to set the addr_len paramater properly before. returning but that's just a bug.. There are also a number of cases wher recvfrom() can return an entirely bogus. address. Anything in rds_recvmsg() that returns a non-negative value but does. not go through the 'sin = (struct sockaddr_in *)msg->msg_name;' code path. at the end of the while(1) loop will return up to 128 bytes of kernel memory. to userspace.. And I write two test programs to reproduce this bug you will see that in. rds_server fromAddr will be overwritten and the following sock_fd will be. destroyed.. Yes it is the programmer's fault to set msg_namelen incorrectly but it is. better to make the kernel copy the real length of address to user space in. such case.. How to run the test programs ?.

VM Sockets allows communication between virtual machines and the hypervisor.. User level applications both in a virtual machine and on the host can use the. VM Sockets API which facilitates fast and efficient communication between. guest virtual machines and their host. A socket address family designed to be. compatible with UDP and TCP at the interface level is provided.. Today VM Sockets is used by various VMware Tools components inside the guest. for zero-config network-less access to VMware host services. In addition to. this VMware's users are using VM Sockets for various applications where. network access of the virtual machine is restricted or non-existent. Examples. of this are VMs communicating with device proxies for proprietary hardware. running as host applications and automated testing of applications running. within virtual machines.. The VMware VM Sockets are similar to other socket types like Berkeley UNIX. socket interface. The VM Sockets module supports both connection-oriented. stream sockets like TCP and connectionless datagram sockets like UDP. The VM. Sockets protocol family is defined as 'AF_VSOCK' and the socket operations. split for SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_STREAM.. For additional information about the use of VM Sockets please refer to the.

https://github.com/torvalds/linux,0c061b5707ab84ebfe8f18f1c9c3110ae5cd6073,1970-01-01 01:00:01+01:00,KEYS: Correctly destroy key payloads when their keytype is removed. unregister_key_type() has code to mark a key as dead and make it unavailable in. one loop and then destroy all those unavailable key payloads in the next loop.. However the loop to mark keys dead renders the key undetectable to the second. loop by changing the key type pointer also.. Fix this by the following means:. (1) The key code has two garbage collectors: one deletes unreferenced keys and. the other alters keyrings to delete links to old dead revoked and expired. keys. They can end up holding each other up as both want to scan the key. serial tree under spinlock. Combine these into a single routine.. (2) Move the dead key marking dead link removal and dead key removal into the. garbage collector as a three phase process running over the three cycles. of the normal garbage collection procedure. This is tracked by the. KEY_GC_REAPING_DEAD_1 _2 and _3 state flags.. unregister_key_type() then just unlinks the key type from the list wakes. up the garbage collector and waits for the third phase to complete.. (3) Downgrade the key types sem in unregister_key_type() once it has deleted. the key type from the list so that it doesn't block the keyctl() syscall.. (4) Dead keys that cannot be simply removed in the third phase have their. payloads destroyed with the key's semaphore write-locked to prevent. interference by the keyctl() syscall. There should be no in-kernel users. of dead keys of that type by the point of unregistration though keyctl(). may be holding a reference.. (5) Only perform timer recalculation in the GC if the timer actually expired.. If it didn't we'll get another cycle when it goes off - and if the key. that actually triggered it has been removed it's not a problem.. (6) Only garbage collect link if the timer expired or if we're doing dead key. clean up phase 2.. (7) As only key_garbage_collector() is permitted to use rb_erase() on the key. serial tree it doesn't need to revalidate its cursor after dropping the. spinlock as the node the cursor points to must still exist in the tree.. (8) Drop the spinlock in the GC if there is contention on it or if we need to. reschedule. After dealing with that get the spinlock again and resume. scanning.. This has been tested in the following ways:. (1) Run the keyutils testsuite against it.. (2) Using the AF_RXRPC and RxKAD modules to test keytype removal:. Load the rxrpc_s key type:. # insmod /tmp/af-rxrpc.ko. # insmod /tmp/rxkad.ko. Create a key (http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/listen.c):. # /tmp/listen &. [1] 8173. Find the key:. # grep rxrpc_s /proc/keys. 091086e1 I--Q-- 1 perm 39390000 0 0 rxrpc_s 52:2. Link it to a session keyring preferably one with a higher serial number:. # keyctl link 0x20e36251 @s. Kill the process (the key should remain as it's linked to another place):. # fg. /tmp/listen. ^C. Remove the key type:. rmmod rxkad. rmmod af-rxrpc. This can be made a more effective test by altering the following part of. the patch:. if (unlikely(gc_state & KEY_GC_REAPING_DEAD_2)) {. /* Make sure everyone revalidates their keys if we marked a. * bunch as being dead and make sure all keyring ex-payloads. * are destroyed.. */. kdebug('dead sync');. synchronize_rcu();. To call synchronize_rcu() in GC phase 1 instead. That causes that the. keyring's old payload content to hang around longer until it's RCU. destroyed - which usually happens after GC phase 3 is complete. This. allows the destroy_dead_key branch to be tested.. Reported-by: Benjamin Coddington <bcodding@gmail.com>. Signed-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>.

I found some bugs in readelf code up to version 4.09 of file all. related to PT_NOTE analysis. I made some changes which seems to work. fine (especially on 64-bit Linux platforms where file used to abort on. some Elf64 files).. List of problems and changes (in the included patch) follows:. - it tried to always read sizeof(nbuf) (8kB or so) even when NOTE. section size was smaller; and then it tried to parse (well almost . see below) whole data read to buffer (less than sizeof(nbuf) only. in case of EOF).. I added reading section size from p_filesz field and using it to. limit the number of bytes to read and parse afterwards.. - dophn_exec() used wrong offset to restore file position PT_NOTE. analysis; it should be just savedoffset not savedoffset+offset. (offset is the size of parsed data from NOTE not program header).. - there were wrong conditions when checking note header offset not. allowing to parse whole buffer passed to donote()..

Fix memory leaks discovered by running valgrind over kdbtest and some. related leaks. Many of them result from not calling ldap_msgfree. after an unsuccessful search (as the OpenLDAP documentation requires). or after an exception following a search so many of the fixes move or. add ldap_msgfree calls to cleanup labels.. ldap_osa_free_princ_ent was not used and could not be used because it. frees the container while krb5_lookup_tl_kadm_data uses a. caller-allocated container. Change it to leave the container alone . but to correctly destroy xdrs. Use it in krb5_ldap_put_principal. where princ_ent was leaked.. In krb5_ldap_put_principal subtreelist is declared twice in interior. scopes and not properly freed; move it to function scope and free it. up in the cleanup label. Also in krb5_ldap_put_principal avoiding. decoding multiple KBR5_TL_KADM_DATA values (which we don't expect to. see) as later decodes would cause earlier decodes to leak.. In krb5_encode_krbsecretkey fix a leak of the krb5_data container and. also add an error check when calling asn1_encode_sequence_of_keys;. otherwise we would dereference a null pointer if we run out of memory. encoding keys (very unlikely).. ticket: 7941 (new). target_version: 1.12.2. tags: pullup,ghudson@mit.edu,1.0,1.0,0.212,2014-06-10 23:53:31-04:00,2014-08-21 16:05:10-04:00,CVE-2018-5730,CWE-90,5.5,1,1,0,1,71,9727

This is a small optimization that speeds up tf.constant(list of double . dtype=float64) by 25% and tf.constant(list of double dtype=float32) by. about 10%. (In my machines the benchmarks added in this change go. from 102?s/example to 78?s/example for float64 and from 97?s/example. to 86?s/example for float32). It has no effect on other types of. tf.constant calls.. The optimization consists in:. * Use PyFloat_AS_DOUBLE instead of PyFloat_AsDouble: we know the value. is valid from the previous PyFloat_Check. This avoids a second. PyFloat_Check in PyFloat_AsDouble.. * The explicit infinity value assignment is not needed static_cast<T>. already does that.. * The overflow check can be simplified to testing whether the casted. value is infinity while the original is not.. * Lastly the overflow check only needs to be done if sizeof(T) <. sizeof(double). Since the function is a template in T the entire. overflow check branch is optimized away by the compiler when T == double.. PiperOrigin-RevId: 278888241.

This commit extends more the functionality of `pack-objects` by allowing. it to write out a `.bitmap` index next to any written packs together. with the `.idx` index that currently gets written.. If bitmap writing is enabled for a given repository (either by calling. `pack-objects` with the `--write-bitmap-index` flag or by having. `pack.writebitmaps` set to `true` in the config) and pack-objects is. writing a packfile that would normally be indexed (i.e. not piping to. stdout) we will attempt to write the corresponding bitmap index for the. packfile.. Bitmap index writing happens after the packfile and its index has been. successfully written to disk (`finish_tmp_packfile`). The process is. performed in several steps:. 1. `bitmap_writer_set_checksum`: this call stores the partial. checksum for the packfile being written; the checksum will be. written in the resulting bitmap index to verify its integrity. 2. `bitmap_writer_build_type_index`: this call uses the array of. `struct object_entry` that has just been sorted when writing out. the actual packfile index to disk to generate 4 type-index bitmaps. (one for each object type).. These bitmaps have their nth bit set if the given object is of. the bitmap's type. E.g. the nth bit of the Commits bitmap will be. 1 if the nth object in the packfile index is a commit.. This is a very cheap operation because the bitmap writing code has. access to the metadata stored in the `struct object_entry` array . and hence the real type for each object in the packfile.. 3. `bitmap_writer_reuse_bitmaps`: if there exists an existing bitmap. index for one of the packfiles we're trying to repack this call. will efficiently rebuild the existing bitmaps so they can be. reused on the new index. All the existing bitmaps will be stored. in a `reuse` hash table and the commit selection phase will. prioritize these when selecting as they can be written directly. to the new index without having to perform a revision walk to. fill the bitmap. This can greatly speed up the repack of a. repository that already has bitmaps.. 4. `bitmap_writer_select_commits`: if bitmap writing is enabled for. a given `pack-objects` run the sequence of commits generated. during the Counting Objects phase will be stored in an array.. We then use that array to build up the list of selected commits.. Writing a bitmap in the index for each object in the repository. would be cost-prohibitive so we use a simple heuristic to pick. the commits that will be indexed with bitmaps.. The current heuristics are a simplified version of JGit's. original implementation. We select a higher density of commits. depending on their age: the 100 most recent commits are always. selected after that we pick 1 commit of each 100 and the gap. increases as the commits grow older. On top of that we make sure. that every single branch that has not been merged (all the tips. that would be required from a clone) gets their own bitmap and. when selecting commits between a gap we tend to prioritize the. commit with the most parents.. Do note that there is no right/wrong way to perform commit. selection; different selection algorithms will result in. different commits being selected but there's no such thing as. 'missing a commit'. The bitmap walker algorithm implemented in. `prepare_bitmap_walk` is able to adapt to missing bitmaps by. performing manual walks that complete the bitmap: the ideal. selection algorithm however would select the commits that are. more likely to be used as roots for a walk in the future (e.g.. the tips of each branch and so on) to ensure a bitmap for them. is always available.. 5. `bitmap_writer_build`: this is the computationally expensive part. of bitmap generation. Based on the list of commits that were. selected in the previous step we perform several incremental. walks to generate the bitmap for each commit.. The walks begin from the oldest commit and are built up. incrementally for each branch. E.g. consider this dag where A B . C D E F are the selected commits and a b c e are a chunk. of simplified history that will not receive bitmaps.. A---a---B--b--C--c--D. \. E--e--F. We start by building the bitmap for A using A as the root for a. revision walk and marking all the objects that are reachable. until the walk is over. Once this bitmap is stored we reuse the. bitmap walker to perform the walk for B assuming that once we. reach A again the walk will be terminated because A has already. been SEEN on the previous walk.. This process is repeated for C and D but when we try to. generate the bitmaps for E we can reuse neither the current walk. nor the bitmap we have generated so far.. What we do now is resetting both the walk and clearing the. bitmap and performing the walk from scratch using E as the. origin. This new walk however does not need to be completed.. Once we hit B we can lookup the bitmap we have already stored. for that commit and OR it with the existing bitmap we've composed. so far allowing us to limit the walk early.. After all the bitmaps have been generated another iteration. through the list of commits is performed to find the best XOR. offsets for compression before writing them to disk. Because of. the incremental nature of these bitmaps XORing one of them with. its predecesor results in a minimal 'bitmap delta' most of the. time. We can write this delta to the on-disk bitmap index and. then re-compose the original bitmaps by XORing them again when. loaded.. This is a phase very similar to pack-object's `find_delta` (using. bitmaps instead of objects of course) except the heuristics. have been greatly simplified: we only check the 10 bitmaps before. any given one to find best compressing one. This gives good. results in practice because there is locality in the ordering of. the objects (and therefore bitmaps) in the packfile.. 6. `bitmap_writer_finish`: the last step in the process is. serializing to disk all the bitmap data that has been generated. in the two previous steps.. The bitmap is written to a tmp file and then moved atomically to. its final destination using the same process as. `pack-write.c:write_idx_file`.. Signed-off-by: Vicent Marti <tanoku@gmail.com>.
